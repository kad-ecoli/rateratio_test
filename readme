rateratio.test: An Exact Rate Ratio Test Assuming Poisson Counts

Description
    Performs the uniformy most powerful unbiased test on the ratio of rates
    of two Poisson counts with given time (e.g., perons-years) at risk for
    each count.

Usage
    from rateratio import test as rateratio_test
    rateratio_test(x, n, RR = 1, 
        alternative = "two.sided",
        conf_level = 0.95)

Arguments
    x               a vector of length 2 with counts for the two rates
    n               a vector of length 2 with time at risk in each rate
    RR              the null rate ratio (two.sided) or the rate ratio on
                    boundary between null and alternative
    alternative     a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
                    must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or
                    "less".  You can specify just the initial letter.
    conf_level      confidence level of the returned confidence interval.
                    Must be a single number between 0 and 1.

Details
    The rateratio.test tests whether the ratio of the first rate (estimated
    by x[0]/n[0] over the second rate (estimated by x[1]/n[1]) is either
    equal to, less, or greater than RR. The two-sided p-value is defined as
    either 1 or twice the minimum of the one-sided p-values.
    See Lehmann (1986, p. 152). For full discussion of the p-value and
    confidence interval consistency of inferences, see Fay (2010).

Value
    An object of class "htest" containing the following components:
    p_value         the p-value of the test
    estimate        a vector with the rate ratio and the two individual rates
    null_value      the null rate ratio (two.sided) or the rate ratio on
                    boundary between null and alternative
    conf_int        confidence interval
    alternative     type of alternative hypothesis
